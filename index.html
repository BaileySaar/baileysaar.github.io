                    <h2>Favorite Games</h2>
                    <p class="green">Doing games instead of movies or books because I rarely ever watch movies, and I'm too indecisive about my favorite books.</p>
                    <p class="pink">My favorite games.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Minecraft</li>
                        <p class="comment">This is due to the calming state of the game, as well as the playability that exists in the game. Plus, with mods and modpacks, the game has even more playability.</p>
                        <li>Terraria</li>
                        <p class="comment">This is due to the expansive volume of game content. Many bosses, hundreds of different weapons and items. The amount of replayability in the game is crazy, and this isn't even considering when you start playing with mods.</p>
                        <li>Metroid Dread</li>
                        <p class="comment">Metroidvania, good game, would recommend.</p>
                        <li>Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knights</li>
                        <p class="comment">Another metroidvania, also a good game would recommend.</p>
